                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                Whenever you visit a social network or a comments section,
                this extension will color known trans-friendly (green) and anti-trans (red) users/pages differently.

                <h3>Which sites are supported?</h3>
                This extension supports Twitter, Bluesky, Mastodon, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, Medium, YouTube, Wikipedia articles, search engine results and all the sites with Disqus comments.

                <h3>How does it know how to color each page?</h3>
                The initial version has been created through a mix of manual labeling and machine learning,
                but you can contribute with your own labels.

                <h3>Does it submit the list of pages that appear on my screen?</h3>
                No, the check is done offline, on your computer.

                <h3>Which criteria is used to determine the label?</h3>
                This extension is focused on anti-trans (including anti-nonbinary) sentiment, of all flavors:
                <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans-exclusionary_radical_feminism">radfem/terf</a>,
                <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gender_ideology">religious</a>,
                <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right">alt-right</a> etc.
                (although most of the data is about the first group). See the guidelines below for more details.

                <h3>I think a page is labeled incorrectly</h3>
                Right click its link, <code>Shinigami Eyes</code> -&gt; <code>Mark as (whatever is appropriate)</code>.
                Your contribution will help us improve this extension.

                <h3>Can I see the list of pages and their labels?</h3>
                While the data is stored locally on your computer, it's represented as a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a>.
                It's a data structure that "remembers" whether it contains
                something or not, but that is unable to explicitely list what it contains.
                It's susceptible to false positives, but there should be very few of them.</p>

                <h3><a name="install-on-mobile">Can I use it on my phone?</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, but only on Android:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Firefox for Android</a></li>
                        <li>Using Firefox, install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shinigami-eyes/">Shinigami Eyes</a></li>
                    </ol>
                    Note however that you won't be able to right-click (and therefore set new labels).
                </p>

                <h3>Is there a mechanism in place to prevent malicious/fake reports?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. While your overrides are immediately visible to you, changes are included in the publicly visible dataset only if they pass some trustworthiness criteria (including human validation).
                </p>

                <h3>What's the origin of this extension's name?</h3>
                <p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Death Note</a> manga/anime,
                    "having the shinigami eyes" means being able to see people's names and remaining lifespan just by
                    looking at them. In a similar way, this extension allows you to see a person's trans acceptance
                    orientation just by looking at them.</p>
                <h3>Why did you create this extension?</h3>
                <p>As a transgender person, I got used to be distrustful towards people. While guessing the attitudes
                    of an
                    openly <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pope_Francis#On_gender.2C_sex_and_sexuality">conservative</a>
                    person or group towards transgender people is easy, this is much more difficult when you deal with
                    communities that tend to be moderately progressive or with intersectional interests, such as the <a
                        href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans-exclusionary_radical_feminism">feminist</a>
                    community, the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/07/anti-trans-group-allowed-to-lead-pride-in-london-march-after-hijack/">lesbian</a> community,
                    women's associations and the <a href="https://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2014/05/atheist-transphobia-superstition-over-science/">
                    atheist</a> community.
                    <p>
                    The purpose of this extension is to make transgender people feel more confident towards people,
                    groups, and pages they can trust, and to highlight possible interactions with the trans-hostile
                    ones (when this is not already evident, such as when discussing about common LGBT or feminist goals).
